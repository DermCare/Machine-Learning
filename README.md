# Machine Learning
In this project, we make a model to find out what skin disease the user is experiencing according to the input submitted. 

There are **2 models** in the DermCare application. 
The 1st model contains a transfer learning model called MobileNetV3Small that we use to improve accuracy by using fine tuning methods
The 2nd model contains a recommendation system model that provides drug recommendations to overcome the problems experienced by users according to the results given from the 1st model

We train our model with 90 Epoch (use early_stopping) and 10 Epoch for the Fine Tuning (use early_stopping)

We got the result :
